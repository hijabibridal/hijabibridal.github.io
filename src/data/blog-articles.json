      "htmlBody": "<p>So you’ve found the perfect outfit, but the belly isn't covered! A lehenga with a covered stomach is an idea, but they aren't easily found.</p><p>But wait. Why do we even have Indian wear on an Islamic site? Well, that’s a great question! Lehengas are actually Muslim attire, but they have been altered.</p><h2>Can Muslims Wear Lehenga?</h2><p>Muslims can wear lehenga as long as the blouse or shirt is long. It should at least come to hip length, but it can actually fall under the knee. At Hijabi Bridal, we consider the bridal lehengas to be Islamic when they come with an option to make the blouse hip length, at least, or when the blouse fabric is an unstitched meter so you can make it yourself.</p><p>If you're going to have your Islamic bridal lehenga tailored, we recommend purchasing two so that you have enough fabric for sleeves and a shirt as long as you like. The skirts for these are semi-stitched, so you can pair two skirts as one for a super full bridal look. We've curated all our Muslim bridal lehengas online from Amazon to make sure they meet the requirements mentioned here. Browse our selection of wedding lehengas for Muslim brides, and don't forget to search by color!</p><h2>Is the Lehenga Indian or Pakistani? Islamic Influences</h2><p>Back to the history. Islamic influences have been profoundly impactful in India, particularly following the arrival of Islamic rulers and traders in the Indian subcontinent around the 12th century. Then because India was ruled by Muslims for centuries, Hindus adopted Muslim dressing styles. Pakistan later separated from India, so the lehenga can be said to be Indian and Pakistani, both.</p><p>However, because most modern options are not lehengas with a covered stomach, we have to scour search results for Muslim bridal lehengas online. One of the reasons Hijabi Bridal exists is so that you can find your Islamic bridal lehenga easily and have it shipped to your door from Amazon. The subcontinent is still the primary source of cotton and silk fabrics, embroidered gowns and Islamic wear. Luckily all this has made its way to the West.</p><h2>What Culture is the Lehenga From? A Fusion of Styles</h2><p>One of the most prominent periods of Islamic influence on Indian dress styles began with the establishment of the Mughal Empire in the early 16th century. The Mughal rulers, originally from Central Asia, brought with them a unique cultural heritage that left a lasting imprint on Indian clothing. The lehenga originated under these Muslim rulers.</p><p>Mughal fashion blended Persian, Central Asian, and indigenous Indian elements, resulting in a distinct and opulent style. The most notable attire from this era is the Angrakha, a traditional upper garment worn by both men and women. This tunic, characterized by its asymmetric opening and flowing fabric, became a staple in Mughal dress and continues to influence Indian fashion.</p><h3>Textiles and Embellishments</h3><p>Islamic influence also permeated the textiles and embellishment techniques used in Indian clothing. The Mughals introduced new materials, such as luxurious silks and fine muslins, as well as intricate embroidery styles, including zardozi and chikankari for Islamic bridal lehengas.</p><h2>How Do I Make Adjustments to Create an Islamic Bridal Lehenga?</h2><p>This will depend on how your blouse and full skirt arrive.</p><figure class=\"my-10 text-center\"><div class=\"relative overflow-hidden rounded-2xl shadow-lg border border-pink-50\"><img src=\"/images/gold-bridal-lehenga.webp\" alt=\"Lehenga Blouse (Choli)\" class=\"w-full object-cover\"/></div><figcaption class=\"mt-3 text-sm text-pink-600 font-bold uppercase tracking-widest\">Gold Islamic bridal lehenga, the blouse being an unstitched meter.</figcaption></figure><p>To lengthen the blouse for a lehenga with a covered stomach, consider purchasing two lehengas and use part of the extra blouse or dupatta material to lengthen your blouse. You can use extra dupatta or blouse material to construct sleeves for your Islamic bridal lehenga, but of course, you need a tailor to do this.</p><h3>Lehenga Skirt</h3><p>If your skirt comes semi-stitched, you’re in luck. You can sew two skirts together easily by the seams that are already there. This works particularly well if you’re plus-sized or just want a fuller bridal skirt for your Islamic bridal lehenga.</p><p>Before you buy, consider matching up accessories for your lehenga—including jutti, double dupatta and jewelry—before you buy. We've matched everything by color to make this step easy!<p>Enjoy your wedding preparation.</p><h2>Lehenga Style: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Q. Can Muslims wear a lehenga for their wedding?</h3><p>A. Yes, Muslims can wear a lehenga as long as it is styled modestly. At Hijabi Bridal, we consider a bridal lehenga to be Islamic when the blouse is tailored to at least hip length to cover the midsection. This often requires using extra unstitched fabric or purchasing two sets to ensure there is enough material for a longer shirt and full sleeves.</p><h3>Q. Is the lehenga originally an Islamic garment?</h3><p>A. The lehenga has deep Islamic roots, originating under the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. Mughal rulers brought Central Asian and Persian influences to India, creating a fusion of styles that emphasized elegance and modesty. While modern versions often feature short blouses, the original concept was a modest wedding dress for Muslim brides.</p><h3>Q. How can I cover my belly in a bridal lehenga?</h3><p>A. To create a lehenga with a covered stomach, you can lengthen the blouse (choli) by using a meter of unstitched fabric or by repurposing material from a second matching lehenga set. Additionally, wearing a non-sheer dupatta draped over the midsection or back can provide extra coverage while maintaining a traditional bridal look.</p><h3>Q. How can I make a semi-stitched lehenga skirt fuller?</h3><p>A. If your lehenga skirt comes semi-stitched, you can achieve a super full, royal bridal look by sewing two skirts together along the existing seams. This is a great solution for plus-sized brides or anyone wanting more volume. Adding a full-length petticoat underneath will also help the Islamic bridal lehenga puff and flow correctly.</p><h3>Q. What are common Islamic embroidery styles for bridal lehengas?</h3><p>A. Two prominent embroidery styles with Islamic origins are Zardozi and Chikankari. Zardozi involves intricate metallic thread work, often in gold or silver, while Chikankari is a delicate white-on-white embroidery originating in Lucknow. Both techniques were popularized by Mughal influence and remain staples of modern Islamic bridal wear.</p>",

      "htmlBody": "<p>“Do I have to wear red?” “Why can’t I choose white?” These questions come up a lot for Muslim brides, wherever they live. Should you choose a traditional, red lehenga, or have a more modern look? Both colors hold significant meanings and can make a statement on your special day. To help you decide, let's explore the cultural, traditional, and personal aspects of Muslim bridal colors.</p><h2>White Muslim Wedding Dress</h2><p>The Muslim white wedding dress has modern significance if you live in a non-Western culture. In Africa and the Middle East, Muslim brides used to opt for a heavy splash of color in years past. But now, brides choose Muslim wedding dresses in white in the Middle East and Africa and as far away as Japan.</p><p>White is only traditional for weddings in European and Western cultures. Queen Victoria was the first to use white in the 1800s in England and, since then, it is the go-to color for brides in the West. That’s especially so for Christians.</p><p>So if you’re from a Western country, and maybe you have Christian family members, you’ll probably be expected to use a Muslim white wedding gown on your wedding day. And if you're born Muslim, well, your family might also want you to wear a white Muslim wedding dress if they want a modern look.</p><h2>Meaning of the Red Muslim Wedding Dress</h2><p>Red is the traditional color to wear for Muslim bridal gowns, or lehengas, in Asian cultures. The red bridal outfit is found in Chinese, Bangladeshi, Indian, Korean and Pakistani weddings. It is considered auspicious and symbolizes joy, celebration, and good fortune. Red brings traditional meaning. Wearing a red wedding outfit can honor your Islamic heritage and bring a sense of cultural pride to your wedding.</p><p>But because so many people wear it, it can also be a little boring.</p><h2>Red or White Lehenga?</h2><div class=\"my-10 text-center\"><div class=\"relative overflow-hidden rounded-2xl shadow-lg border border-pink-50\"><img src=\"/images/generated_image_1737308668376.webp\" alt=\"Should I wear red for my Muslim wedding?\" class=\"w-full object-cover\"/></div></div><p>If you're wearing an Islamic lehenga with the stomach covered, should you choose red or white? Well, in the West, red is associated with love, boldness, passion and flirtation. It's anything but boring there, but it’s not quite the celebratory color associated with good fortune in the East. White, on the other hand, brings up thoughts of purity, innocence and new beginnings in the West. Choices, choices!</p><h2>Champagne and Pastel Color Lehengas for the Bride</h2><div class=\"my-10 text-center\"><div class=\"relative overflow-hidden rounded-2xl shadow-lg border border-pink-50\"><img src=\"/images/e6d25e_9a1b39ef66284c9d94c9d5ef251b37eb~mv2.png.webp\" alt=\"champagne muslim wedding dress\" class=\"w-full object-cover\"/></div></div><p>Colors beside red or white lehengas, have, gratefully, become more popular over time. Mid-range colors, like orange and vibrant green, saw their wedding days in the end of the last century. In 2024, as girls try to move away from red but don’t want a Muslim white wedding dress, pastels are everywhere.</p><p>Pastel color lehengas for the bride allow every girl to have a splash of flattering color, considering that every skin shade doesn’t look great with vibrant colors like red, green or orange. But it’s guaranteed that your favorite pastel looks will look great on you, despite your complexion and undertones.</p><p>Imagine: light green, champagne, lavender, pink! Just choose a color that makes you feel comfortable and confident. Your wedding day is one of the most important days of your life. Wear something that makes you feel beautiful and happy.</p><p>And it's up to you!
