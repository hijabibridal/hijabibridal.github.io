Muslim Groom Outfit: Get the Utmost Style
Author: Hijabi Bridal
What does a Muslim groom wear? Well, let's just say that his Muslim groom outfit is almost as important as the bridal dress. The pair will wear the same colors, or at least the same color of accents. But the groom's Muslim wedding attire will also reflect his personality with elegance and sophistication. Tuxedos are not dressy enough, by half! A Muslim groom outfit is showcased with nice thobes, shalwar kameez and embroidered sherwani. And layers are part of the blessed sunnah. So don’t forget the waistcoat. 


Read further to  create a memorable look that’s appropriate for the day. 


The Right Muslim Groom Outfit: The Thobe 

The most ornate Muslim groom wedding dress is a thobe with a waistcoat and sherwani, compared with Muslim groom sherwani look.

Your guests will never see a thobe the same way.
The thobe, also known as a dishdasha, is a traditional garment worn by men in many Arab or Muslim-majority countries. It is a long robe that is typically ankle-length and features a simple, yet elegant design. For a Muslim groom outfit, the thobe can be elevated with the right accessories to create a distinguished and stylish look.


Thobe Design

To make it dressy, choose a cotton blend thobe that has a sateen finish. West Africans use a garment called a boubou, which is like a thobe and aba combined. It’s colorful, and part of the drape covers the shoulders to make it ultra dressy. Tip: Don’t choose a regular aba. It’s too bland for Muslim groom dress and is best left to the persons officiating the ceremony.


Regular embroidered or embellished thobes add a touch of sophistication and can make the Muslim groom wedding outfit. Match the thobe to the wedding theme by using accessories, vest and turban in the bride’s colors and style. 


Traditional Eastern Shoes for the Thobe

For an unexpected touch of flair, pair the thobe with traditional eastern shoes, such as khussa or mojari. These handmade shoes feature intricate embroidery and beadwork. Ideally, they will match the traditional shoes of the bride. 


Matching a Turban with a Thobe
A topi or white imama won’t do for Muslim groom dress, no matter how fancy it looks on Fridays. The turban should help the bride and groom match in color, and can carry matching jewelry and even flowers. It’s pretty much the only time a man will look so decked. The turban is what brings the whole style together. But if the bride is wearing pink or peach, mild down the color by matching the turban to the thobe and using subtle embellishments or embroidery to match the bride.  


Embroidered Waistcoat and Thobe 
Adding a vest to a thobe ensemble can create a polished and refined look. Opt for a vest that complements the color and design of the thobe. Embroidered or brocade vests can add a touch of luxury to the Muslim groom wedding outfit and enhance his overall appearance.


By combining the thobe with traditional eastern shoes, a matching turban, and a vest, the groom can achieve a timeless look that reflects his cultural heritage and personal style.




Shalwar Kameez for the Muslim Groom Outfit

Like the thobe, shalwar kameez is a semi-dressy, but totally daily look. It comes from South Asia, but it was traditionally used all over the Muslim world. The long tunic is the kameez or kurta, and the loose-fitting trousers are shalwar. To get the best Muslim groom dress, he can match a satin-finished shalwar kameez with a long sherwani to create a sophisticated and elegant ensemble.


Shalwar Kameez Design 
Choose a shalwar kameez made from a heavy cotton that will hold its shape. Even if the bride is wearing pastel, opt for rich colors like deep maroon, royal blue, or emerald green for the Muslim wedding groom dress that will be the darker version of the pastel bridal color. 



Long Sherwani and Kameez
A sherwani is a long coat-like garment worn over the shalwar kameez. It is typically heavily embroidered and adds a kingly touch to the Muslim groom wedding outfit. Choose a sherwani for the groom that compliments the color of the shalwar kameez and the embroidery pattern of the bridal wear. The sherwani can feature ornate patterns, gold or silver thread work, and intricate detailing.


Waistcoat Layered with Kameez and Sherwani
For classy layers, add a waistcoat under the sherwani. If the sherwani is embroidered, the waistcoat can be of the same fabric for a magnificent Muslim groom dress. Or both the sherwani and waistcoat can be of plain fabric, if you like things more toned down. Just make sure they both match the shalwar kameez and dress it up with a watch chain and flowers. 


Turban Matching the Sherwani
A matching turban is an essential accessory that completes the Muslim groom wedding outfit. Choose a turban that coordinates with the color and design of the shalwar kameez and sherwani. The turban can be adorned with a brooch, feather or trailing jasmine flowers or pearls to add a touch of sophistication.


Muslim Groom Dress Shoes with a Kameez
Pair the shalwar kameez and sherwani with Western dress shoes for refined and elegant Islamic wedding wear.  Ensure that the shoes are new, well-polished and in perfect condition to complete the groom's ensemble. Traditional footwear such as khussa can add an authentic touch, if needed.


The Go-To: Embroidered Sherwani for the Muslim Groom Outfit

The sherwani is a traditional, go-to garment for Muslim groom dress. It’s worn by men in South Asia and other Muslim-majority regions. The wedding sherwani is a thigh-length, coat-like garment that, when worn without a tunic, is typically heavily embroidered and worn over matching pants that might also be embroidered in part.  In Indonesia, grooms typically use a shorter embroidered jacket and an embroidered waist wrapper. In South Asia, embroidered sherwanis for grooms are used very frequently, so let’s add a few touches to make them unique.


Embroidered Sherwani Design
An embroidered wedding sherwani for a Muslim groom outfit is usually of brocade or velvet. Make sure to get an embroidery style that’s similar to what the bride is using. The best embroidered sherwanis are made as part of a bridal set and match perfectly with the bride. We’ve seen them in light green, red, gold and maroon.


The bride and groom should match as far as possible. But maybe the bride has chosen a distinctly feminine color, like crimson. If so, the embroidery style and color of the sherwani should imitate the same look. If she’s wearing a pastel color, like pink, choose a matching deep shade of maroon or eggplant to compliment the color. If she chose light blue, go for dark blue. This coordinates the look of the Muslim groom outfit.


Matching Pants Come with the Embroidered Sherwani
Embroidered sherwanis for Muslim groom wedding outfits usually come with matching pants. Wearing a different pair might break the harmony of matching with the bride. If there are sizing issues, take the pants to a tailor to resize them. It’s worth it. 


The Best Turban for an Embroidered Sherwani
A sherwani is usually worn with a high, Indian-style, Muslim groom turban in a peacock style. Go for it! An imama that matches the sherwani exactly should work well, also. Just add dangling jasmine flowers to the headgear to make it all royal again. Then the matching shawl worn over the shoulder will truly bring out the king-vibes. 


What Shoes for an Embroidered Sherwani?
Wear khussa to complete your Mughal Islamic wedding clothing, or shine up those dress shoes to match.



What About Accessories for the Muslim Groom Outfit?

Muslim men won't wear bangles like the bride. But there are some things they can do to spice up their look. 


Necklaces: Most Muslim grooms wear necklaces that match either their own colors or the accessories of the bride. That can be a pearl or gold finished necklace and it can be a short set or a long and short duo. 

Flowers: Nothing brings out the charm of a Muslim groom like a few flowers. You can add hanging jasmine flowers to the back of your turban, or wear a necklace of flowers. At the least, use your breast pocket to house a few. 

Ring: Muslim grooms don't always use wedding bands, but a groom should certainly use a ring with a nice stone that matches his clothing. This makes you look regal. 

Dupatta: A thin dupatta around the neck is nice, but a full woolen, embroidered shawl hung on your shoulder and arm is perfect for a Muslim groom outfit. 

Shoes: If you aren't into men's jutti, or you don't have the time to break them in, wear new, polished dress shoes. Your dress socks, of course, should match your shoes.


So what does a Muslim groom wear?  Whether it’s a thobe with traditional eastern shoes, a shalwar kameez with a long sherwani, or an embroidered sherwani with matching pants, each option offers a unique and stylish look for the big day. By carefully selecting the right fabrics, colors, and accessories, you can create a memorable and regal appearance that reflects your values and personality -- the best wedding dress for a Muslim groom!

Muslim Groom Style: Frequently Asked Questions

Q. What does a Muslim groom wear? 

A. A Muslim groom typically wears traditional garments that reflect elegance and modesty, such as a thobe, shalwar kameez, or an embroidered sherwani. Since layers are part of the sunnah, a Muslim groom outfit is often showcased with a waistcoat or vest to create a regal and sophisticated appearance that matches the bride. Speaking of layers, the bride should ensure her bridal dupatta draping is as regal as the Muslim groom attire. See our guide on 4 ways to wrap bridal shawls for a regal look.


Q. How can a thobe be styled as a Muslim groom wedding attire? 

A. To make a thobe appropriate for a wedding, opt for a cotton blend with a sateen finish. You can elevate this Muslim groom wedding attire by adding an embroidered or brocade waistcoat, traditional eastern shoes like mojari, and a fancy turban that matches the bride’s color theme.


Q. What is the difference between a thobe and a sherwani for a Muslim groom outfit? 

A. While both are popular choices, a thobe is a long, ankle-length robe common in Arab countries, whereas a sherwani is a long coat-like garment traditional to South Asia. The sherwani is often the "go-to" Muslim groom outfit for those seeking heavy embroidery and a Mughal prince coordinate for their bride.


Q. How should a Muslim groom coordinate colors with the bride? 

A. Coordination is key for a unified look. The Muslim groom should match the bride’s accents. If she is wearing pastel colors, the groom should choose a darker, richer version of that hue—such as emerald green for a light green bridal dress—to ensure the Muslim groom wedding attire stands out.


Q. What accessories complete a Muslim groom wedding attire? 

A. Beyond the main garment, a Muslim groom should use a matching turban adorned with a brooch or jasmine flowers, a waistcoat for layering, and either traditional khussa or polished dress shoes. A thick, embroidered shawl (dupatta) hung over the shoulder adds the final kingly touch to the look.

Why Bridal Lehengas are Islamic (And How to Cover Your Belly in One)
Writer: Hijabi Bridal

So you’ve found the perfect outfit, but the belly isn't covered! A lehenga with a covered stomach is an idea, but they aren't easily found. 


But wait. Why do we even have Indian wear on an Islamic site? Well, that’s a great question! Lehengas are actually Muslim attire, but they have been altered. 


Can Muslims Wear Lehenga?

Muslims can wear lehenga as long as the blouse or shirt is long. It should at least come to hip length, but it can actually fall under the knee. At Hijabi Bridal, we consider the bridal lehengas to be Islamic when they come with an option to make the blouse hip length, at least, or when the blouse fabric is an unstitched meter so you can make it yourself. 


If you're going to have your Islamic bridal lehenga tailored, we recommend purchasing two so that you have enough fabric for sleeves and a shirt as long as you like. The skirts for these are semi-stitched, so you can pair two skirts as one for a super full bridal look. We've curated all our Muslim bridal lehengas online from Amazon to make sure they meet the requirements mentioned here. Browse our selection of wedding lehengas for Muslim brides, and don't forget to search by color!



Is the Lehenga Indian or Pakistani? Islamic Influences in Indian Dress Style

Back to the history.  Islamic influences have been profoundly impactful in India, particularly following the arrival of Islamic rulers and traders in the Indian subcontinent around the 12th century. Then because India was ruled by Muslims for centuries, Hindus adopted Muslim dressing styles. Pakistan later separated from India, so the lehenga can be said to be Indian and Pakistani, both. 


However, because most modern options are not lehengas with a covered stomach, we have to scour search results for Muslim bridal lehengas online. One of the reasons Hijabi Bridal exists is so that you can find your Islamic bridal lehenga easily and have it shipped to your door from Amazon. The subcontinent is still the primary source of cotton and silk fabrics, embroidered gowns and Islamic wear. Luckily all this has made it's way to the West.


There are a handful of Islamic lehengas with long blouses online. Check our Muslim lehenga page to see our full collection. 


What Culture is the Lehenga From? A Fusion of Styles

One of the most prominent periods of Islamic influence on Indian dress styles began with the establishment of the Mughal Empire in the early 16th century. The Mughal rulers, originally from Central Asia, brought with them a unique cultural heritage that left a lasting imprint on Indian clothing. The lehenga originated under these Muslim rulers. Other Indian fashion did too.


Mughal fashion blended Persian, Central Asian, and indigenous Indian elements, resulting in a distinct and opulent style. The most notable attire from this era is the Angrakha, a traditional upper garment worn by both men and women. This tunic, characterized by its asymmetric opening and flowing fabric, became a staple in Mughal dress and continues to influence Indian fashion.


The Salwar Kameez, a combination of a long tunic (kameez) and trousers (salwar), also gained popularity during this period. The attire was not only practical and comfortable but also carried a sense of modesty, aligning with Islamic principles of dress. The dupatta, a long scarf or shawl worn with the salwar kameez, further added to the elegance and modesty of the ensemble.


Textiles and Embellishments

Islamic influence also permeated the textiles and embellishment techniques used in Indian clothing. The Mughals introduced new materials, such as luxurious silks and fine muslins, as well as intricate embroidery styles, including zardozi and chikankari for Islamic bridal lehengas.


Zardozi Embroidery involves intricate metallic thread work, often incorporating gold and silver threads to create elaborate patterns. This technique became synonymous with Mughal regalia and has since been integral to Indian bridal wear and wedding lehengas for Muslim brides alike.

Chikankari is another embroidery technique that flourished under Islamic influence. Originating in Lucknow, this art form involves delicate and intricate white-on-white embroidery, that's perfectly used for modern Islamic bridal lehengas. Chikankari creates subtle yet elegant patterns on fine fabrics like muslin and silk.



Jewelry and Accessories


Islamic aesthetics also shaped Indian jewelry and accessories. The jhoomar or passa, a fan-shaped headpiece worn on one side of the head, is a traditional accessory that became popular during the Mughal period and remains a cherished part of bridal attire in many parts of India. These accessories, when matched with an Islamic lehenga and with the use of precious gemstones and intricate metalwork, reflect the opulence and sophistication of Mughal artistry.


Continued Influence

The influence of Islamic culture on Indian dress styles did not wane with the fall of the Mughal Empire. Instead, these influences have been seamlessly woven into the fabric of Indian fashion. Contemporary Indian designers often draw inspiration from Mughal and Islamic motifs, incorporating them into modern attire while preserving their traditional essence.


The enduring popularity of garments like the bridal lehenga, sharara and anarkali suits, all of which bear Islamic influences, highlights the lasting impact of this cultural exchange. So although the lehenga, in particular, has been altered to show more skin than is allowed under Islamic traditions, the concept is originally Islamic. These were wedding lehengas for Muslim brides.


How Do I Make Adjustments to Create an Islamic Bridal Lehenga?

This will depend on how your blouse and full skirt arrive.

Gold Islamic bridal lehenga, the blouse being an unstitched meter.
Lehenga Blouse (Choli)
Most bridal lehengas come as a short blouse that displays the back and midriff, or it may simply include a meter of decorated fabric for you to sew yourself. If your dupatta isn’t see-through and you wear it to the back, you might be able to get away with just lengthening the blouse for a belly covered lehenga and not worrying about the way the back is cut. 


To lengthen the blouse for a lehenga with a covered stomach, consider purchasing two lehengas and use part of the extra blouse or dupatta material to lengthen your blouse. You can use exta dupatta or blouse material to construct sleeves for your Islamic bridal lehenga, but of course, you need a tailor to do this. 


If you’re using the meter of cloth, plus extras, to construct your blouse, use your exact measurements and a fitted woven blouse pattern to make it. Use a fitted pattern because wedding sets are generally fitted in the bust area and then flow over your curves. This makes an assumption that a dupatta will be used to cover your chest curves.


Lehenga Skirt
If your skirt comes semi-stitched, you’re in luck. You can sew two skirts together easily by the seams that are already there. Attach the draw strings in the middle and put them through the upper area. This works particularly well  if you’re plus sized or just want a fuller bridal skirt for your Islamic bridal lehenga. 


If your skirt comes already sewn, you’ll have to pick apart the seam or seams to add another skirt to it. Don’t forget the zipper!


Before You Buy

Consider the measurements of the bridal lehenga set before you buy it, so that you can see if you'll need one or two. Don't forget your full length petticoat. It will help your Islamic bridal lehenga puff and flow. Also consider matching up accessories for your lehenga -- including jutti, double dupatta and jewelry -- before you buy. This way you know for sure you can get the complete look you want. We've matched everything by color to make this step easy! 

Enjoy your wedding preparation.

Your Muslim Wedding Dress: White or Red?
Writer: Hijabi Bridal

“Do I have to wear red?” “Why can’t I choose white?” These questions come up a lot for Muslim brides, wherever they live. Should you choose a traditional, red lehenga, or have a more modern look? Both colors hold significant meanings and can make a statement on your special day. To help you decide, let's explore the cultural, traditional, and personal aspects of Muslim bridal colors.


White Muslim Wedding Dress

The Muslim white wedding dress has modern significance if you live in a non-Western culture. In Africa and the Middle East, Muslim brides used to opt for a heavy splash of color in years past. But now, brides choose Muslim wedding dresses in white in the Middle East and Africa and as far away as Japan. 


White is only traditional for weddings in European and Western cultures. Queen Victoria was the first to use white in the 1800s in England and, since then, it is the go-to color for brides in the West. That’s especially so for Christians. 


So if you’re from a Western country, and maybe you have Christian family members, you’ll probably be expected to use a Muslim white wedding gown on your wedding day. And if you're born Muslim, well, your family might also want you to wear a white Muslim wedding dress if they want a modern look.


Meaning of the Red Muslim Wedding Dress

Red is the traditional color to wear for Muslim bridal gowns, or lehengas, in Asian cultures. The  red bridal outfit is found in Chinese, Bangladeshi, Indian, Korean and Pakistani weddings. It is considered auspicious and symbolizes joy, celebration, and good fortune. Red brings traditional  meaning. Wearing a red wedding outfit can honor your Islamic heritage and bring a sense of cultural pride to your wedding. 

But because so many people wear it, it can also be a little boring. 


Red or White Lehenga?

If you're wearing an Islamic lehenga with the stomach covered, should you choose red or white? Well, in the West, red is associated with love, boldness, passion and flirtation. It's anything but boring there, but it’s not quite the celebratory color associated with good fortune in the East. White, on the other hand, brings up thoughts of purity, innocence and new beginnings in the West. Choices, choices!


Pastel Color Lehengas for the Bride

Colors beside red or white lehengas, have, gratefully, become more popular over time. Mid-range colors, like orange and vibrant green, saw their wedding days in the end of the last century. In 2024, as girls try to move away from red but don’t want a Muslim white wedding dress, pastels are everywhere. 


Pastel color lehengas for the bride allow every girl to have a splash of flattering color, considering that every skin shade doesn’t look great with vibrant colors like red, green or orange. But it’s guaranteed that your favorite pastel looks will look great on you, despite your complexion and undertones.

Imagine: light green, lavender, pink! Just choose a color that makes you feel comfortable and confident. Your wedding day is one of the most important days of your life. Wear something that makes you feel beautiful and happy.

Color Guide: Frequently Asked Questions

Q. What color do Muslim brides wear? 

A. What color do Muslim brides wear usually depends on their cultural background. In South Asia, a red Muslim wedding dress is the most traditional choice, representing good fortune. However, modern brides are increasingly choosing a variety of shades, including blue, green, and trendy pastels.


Q. Do Muslim brides wear white? 

A. Yes! Do Muslim brides wear white? is a common question. While white became popular in the West after the 1800s, it is now a very common choice for a white Muslim wedding dress in the Middle East, Africa, and among Western Muslim brides who want a look that combines purity with modern style.


Q. Is a red Muslim wedding dress better than a white one? 

A. It's all about your personal style! A red Muslim wedding dress is deeply traditional and bold, perfect for honoring heritage. A white gown or lehenga offers a clean, modern Western aesthetic. Many brides now choose "mid-range" colors or pastels to stand out from both traditions.

Regal Looks: 4 Ways to Double Wrap a Bridal Dupatta as a Hijabi
Writer: Hijabi Bridal

Two dupattas and a head cover?? Hijabi Bridal... are you serious? Yes! One of the best ways to look absolutely regal on your wedding day is to use a second bridal dupatta. In this article, we'll show you four easy wedding dupatta draping styles -- just for the hijabi bride.


*Photographs with lehenga dupattas are for demonstration purposes. All Hijabi Bridal lehengas are Islamic. 


How to Wear Hijab with a Bridal Dupatta


As a hijabi bride, the best way to cover your hair is to disguise your hijab so it isn’t apparent. To do this, pin your hijab tightly to the rear of your head. Then apply the bridal jewelry that is meant for the hairline right at the edge of your hijab. The set above has just what you need. Then right behind the jewelry, place the transparent bridal dupatta that came with your wedding outfit. Wear it to the back. 


Ideally your hijab will be cut in a circular fashion right at the shoulders so that the wedding dupatta blends well with it and hangs properly down your back. It’s going to be long, sort of like a cape, so make sure the ends of your dupatta hang evenly. Use the large necklace from the same set above to cover your neck and upper chest. 


Then add another bridal dupatta that's contrasting in color or matching. See Hijabi Bridal's full wedding dupatta collection here. 


How to Get a Double Dupatta Look

Now that you have your “main look” as a hijabi bride, i.e., your hair and neck are covered, you can play with the extra bridal dupatta style: 


1. You can accordion a heavy transparent dupatta that has a wide border as a double drape.

Another extra wedding dupatta style is to accordion the decorative end of one dupatta over your shoulder, sewing the other end to your wrist on the opposite side. Add a bridal belt over the dupatta on your waist for an extra special touch.

4. Drape a heavy nikkah dupatta, in a contrasting or matching color, over your shoulder and the front of the dress for a beautiful extra dupatta look.

In short, your second can cover as much as you like and is a wonderful, modest way to hide your curves. Better yet, the double wedding dupatta is strictly for brides, so you don't have to worry about your guests looking too regal. Enjoy your day!


Double Dupatta Styling: Frequently Asked Questions

Q. What is the best double dupatta hijab style for a regal look? 

A. To achieve a regal double dupatta hijab style, we recommend using two layers on the head. First is the hijab and the dupatta is pinned close to the hairline to show off the embroidery. This same dupatta can be draped with your hijab around the front. You can accordion a second heavy dupatta over the shoulder for a queenly silhouette.


Q. How do you achieve a seamless bridal dupatta setting with hijab? 

A. Another, more professional look for your bridal dupatta setting with hijab, starts with pinning your hijab tightly toward the back. Apply your hairline jewelry at the very edge of the hijab, then place your transparent dupatta immediately behind it. This allows the dupatta to flow like a cape while your neck is elegantly covered by a statement necklace.


Q. What are the benefits of Muslim bride dupatta draping with two scarves? 

A. The primary benefit of Muslim bride dupatta draping with a second scarf is the added modesty and grandeur it provides. A second dupatta is an excellent way to cover the chest and torso elegantly, ensuring you look like a bride while remaining completely comfortable and modest.


Q. Can you use a contrasting color for a double dupatta look? 

A. Absolutely! Using a contrasting color for your second bridal dupatta adds a modern touch to a traditional ensemble. Pairing a red nikkah dupatta with a silver or champagne base dress, for example, highlights the intricate embroidery and makes your bridal look truly unforgettable.


Guests: What to Wear to a Muslim Wedding?
Writer: Hijabi Bridal


Some families have outdoor weddings, some rent a hall and others prefer the marriage ceremony to take place in a mosque. How will you know what to wear to a Muslim wedding? The venue will tell you just about everything you need to know! 


What to Wear to a Muslim Wedding at a Mosque?

If the wedding is held at a mosque, you can expect the family to be pretty conservative. So while the bride might be decked out, everyone else will be suited up in a modest fashion:


What female guests should wear to a Muslim wedding at a mosque
But what’s modest for Muslims is a bit different than it is for non-Muslims. Ladies are expected to cover all parts of themselves in a loose fashion, especially when entering the mosque. Only the hands and feet show. If you’re not a Muslim, you can wear pants and a long sleeved shirt, and then you still might be handed a scarf. 


So that you’re wearing something you like, the best thing is to find your own abaya with a matching scarf. Abayas are simple, traditionally Islamic garments. They are long, loose-fitting dresses that are made in different colors and styles. Look for a subtle color that has fancy additions like gold or silver beadwork. It doesn’t have to be black. 


Many Muslim female guests will take the same route as yourself, so you won’t feel out of place at all. It’s convenient, too, because you can wear your regular clothing underneath and put your abaya back in its fancy bag when you’re done. If you can’t find a local shop, try an online collection like Aab. You can also easily find an abaya on Amazon.


Whether you’re Muslim or non-Muslim, choose a color that flatters your face and a design that suits you. Well done!


What male guests should wear to a Muslim wedding at a mosque

Most Muslim male guests will use their Friday clothes to attend a wedding with an added fancy topi. The family members will use very dressy, Islamic garb. So if you’re not a family member, keep it toned down. Non-Muslims can wear a pair of decently loose slacks and a tunic that falls to the hips or lower. Your slacks shouldn’t be too tight though, because you’ll be sitting on the floor. You don’t want to split your pants while getting comfortable.


What to wear to a Muslim wedding in a hall?

A hall is for fancy wear, so get ready!


What should female guests wear to a Muslim wedding in a hall?

Wear your best! If you’re Muslim, that means you can wear Eid clothes that you haven’t worn recently. They should be embroidered and flashy. Abayas in this setting are too strict, but you might see older aunties wearing them. Because men aren’t expected to enter the ladies’s side of a hijabi wedding, your hair should be styled for the occasion. 


If you’re not Muslim, you’re still expected to bring some bling and style your hair nicely. The safest option is to wear a long skirt with a long sleeved blouse that has sequins or is otherwise embellished to the hilt. Or you can try a pant suit with a bling top and matching headband and fancy shoes.    


Whether you’re Muslim or non-Muslim, you’ll be expected to don your best heels for the occasion. 


What should male guests wear to a Muslim wedding in a hall?

Non-Muslim men can wear the same pants and short tunic to a wedding in a hall. You can add a suit jacket for a dressier look, or go for a trending suit. If you choose a suit, it should be a really nice one - not a work suit. Muslim men can also wear a trending suit, as long as you’re not a family member. 


If you’re family, you’ll probably want to get a little closer, in look, to the groom. So that means wearing fancy Islamic attire and a nice topi.

 

What to wear to a Muslim wedding that’s outside?

An summer outdoor wedding will be the least strict in attire:


What should a female guest wear to a Muslim wedding that’s outdoors?

Even though the clothes of regular guests will be less conforming to wedding-norms, the family of the bride and groom will likely be asked to wear specific attire or colors to match the couple. So if you’re family, you can expect to receive some form of notification, or just ask. If you’re not family, and you’re a lady, you can dress in a semi-formal manner as long as your chest, arms and legs are covered. If you’re not Muslim, you won’t need any special Islamic clothing or a scarf. If you are Muslim, also wear semi-formal attire.


What should a male guest wear to a Muslim wedding outside?

If you’re family to the bride or groom, again, you’ll probably wear matching suits or similar formal clothing. You should definitely ask if you haven’t been informed what to wear. If you’re not family, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, show up in dress casual. 


Whatever the case, be prepared to enjoy yourself. Gaffes in attire are overlooked when you’re cheerful and ready to participate! Have fun!
