Muslim Groom Outfit: Get the Utmost Style
Author: Hijabi Bridal
What does a Muslim groom wear? Well, let's just say that his Muslim groom outfit is almost as important as the bridal dress. The pair will wear the same colors, or at least the same color of accents. But the groom's Muslim wedding attire will also reflect his personality with elegance and sophistication. Tuxedos are not dressy enough, by half! A Muslim groom outfit is showcased with nice thobes, shalwar kameez and embroidered sherwani. And layers are part of the blessed sunnah. So don’t forget the waistcoat.

The Right Muslim Groom Outfit: The Thobe 

The most ornate Muslim groom wedding dress is a thobe with a waistcoat and sherwani, compared with Muslim groom sherwani look.

Your guests will never see a thobe the same way.
The thobe, also known as a dishdasha, is a traditional garment worn by men in many Arab or Muslim-majority countries. It is a long robe that is typically ankle-length and features a simple, yet elegant design. For a Muslim groom outfit, the thobe can be elevated with the right accessories to create a distinguished and stylish look.


Thobe Design

To make it dressy, choose a cotton blend thobe that has a sateen finish. West Africans use a garment called a boubou, which is like a thobe and aba combined. It’s colorful, and part of the drape covers the shoulders to make it ultra dressy. Tip: Don’t choose a regular aba. It’s too bland for Muslim groom dress and is best left to the persons officiating the ceremony.


Regular embroidered or embellished thobes add a touch of sophistication and can make the Muslim groom wedding outfit. Match the thobe to the wedding theme by using accessories, vest and turban in the bride’s colors and style. 


Traditional Eastern Shoes for the Thobe

For an unexpected touch of flair, pair the thobe with traditional eastern shoes, such as khussa or mojari. These handmade shoes feature intricate embroidery and beadwork. Ideally, they will match the traditional shoes of the bride. 


Matching a Turban with a Thobe
A topi or white imama won’t do for Muslim groom dress, no matter how fancy it looks on Fridays. The turban should help the bride and groom match in color, and can carry matching jewelry and even flowers. It’s pretty much the only time a man will look so decked. The turban is what brings the whole style together. But if the bride is wearing pink or peach, mild down the color by matching the turban to the thobe and using subtle embellishments or embroidery to match the bride.  


Embroidered Waistcoat and Thobe 
Adding a vest to a thobe ensemble can create a polished and refined look. Opt for a vest that complements the color and design of the thobe. Embroidered or brocade vests can add a touch of luxury to the Muslim groom wedding outfit and enhance his overall appearance.


By combining the thobe with traditional eastern shoes, a matching turban, and a vest, the groom can achieve a timeless look that reflects his cultural heritage and personal style.




Shalwar Kameez for the Muslim Groom Outfit

Like the thobe, shalwar kameez is a semi-dressy, but totally daily look. It comes from South Asia, but it was traditionally used all over the Muslim world. The long tunic is the kameez or kurta, and the loose-fitting trousers are shalwar. To get the best Muslim groom dress, he can match a satin-finished shalwar kameez with a long sherwani to create a sophisticated and elegant ensemble.


Shalwar Kameez Design 
Choose a shalwar kameez made from a heavy cotton that will hold its shape. Even if the bride is wearing pastel, opt for rich colors like deep maroon, royal blue, or emerald green for the Muslim wedding groom dress that will be the darker version of the pastel bridal color. 



Long Sherwani and Kameez
A sherwani is a long coat-like garment worn over the shalwar kameez. It is typically heavily embroidered and adds a kingly touch to the Muslim groom wedding outfit. Choose a sherwani for the groom that compliments the color of the shalwar kameez and the embroidery pattern of the bridal wear. The sherwani can feature ornate patterns, gold or silver thread work, and intricate detailing.


Waistcoat Layered with Kameez and Sherwani
For classy layers, add a waistcoat under the sherwani. If the sherwani is embroidered, the waistcoat can be of the same fabric for a magnificent Muslim groom dress. Or both the sherwani and waistcoat can be of plain fabric, if you like things more toned down. Just make sure they both match the shalwar kameez and dress it up with a watch chain and flowers. 


Turban Matching the Sherwani
A matching turban is an essential accessory that completes the Muslim groom wedding outfit. Choose a turban that coordinates with the color and design of the shalwar kameez and sherwani. The turban can be adorned with a brooch, feather or trailing jasmine flowers or pearls to add a touch of sophistication.


Muslim Groom Dress Shoes with a Kameez
Pair the shalwar kameez and sherwani with Western dress shoes for refined and elegant Islamic wedding wear.  Ensure that the shoes are new, well-polished and in perfect condition to complete the groom's ensemble. Traditional footwear such as khussa can add an authentic touch, if needed.


The Go-To: Embroidered Sherwani for the Muslim Groom Outfit

The sherwani is a traditional, go-to garment for Muslim groom dress. It’s worn by men in South Asia and other Muslim-majority regions. The wedding sherwani is a thigh-length, coat-like garment that, when worn without a tunic, is typically heavily embroidered and worn over matching pants that might also be embroidered in part.  In Indonesia, grooms typically use a shorter embroidered jacket and an embroidered waist wrapper. In South Asia, embroidered sherwanis for grooms are used very frequently, so let’s add a few touches to make them unique.


Embroidered Sherwani Design
An embroidered wedding sherwani for a Muslim groom outfit is usually of brocade or velvet. Make sure to get an embroidery style that’s similar to what the bride is using. The best embroidered sherwanis are made as part of a bridal set and match perfectly with the bride. We’ve seen them in light green, red, gold and maroon.


The bride and groom should match as far as possible. But maybe the bride has chosen a distinctly feminine color, like crimson. If so, the embroidery style and color of the sherwani should imitate the same look. If she’s wearing a pastel color, like pink, choose a matching deep shade of maroon or eggplant to compliment the color. If she chose light blue, go for dark blue. This coordinates the look of the Muslim groom outfit.


Matching Pants Come with the Embroidered Sherwani
Embroidered sherwanis for Muslim groom wedding outfits usually come with matching pants. Wearing a different pair might break the harmony of matching with the bride. If there are sizing issues, take the pants to a tailor to resize them. It’s worth it. 


The Best Turban for an Embroidered Sherwani
A sherwani is usually worn with a high, Indian-style, Muslim groom turban in a peacock style. Go for it! An imama that matches the sherwani exactly should work well, also. Just add dangling jasmine flowers to the headgear to make it all royal again. Then the matching shawl worn over the shoulder will truly bring out the king-vibes.

Wear khussa to complete your Mughal Islamic wedding clothing, or shine up those dress shoes to match.



What About Accessories for the Muslim Groom Outfit?

Muslim men won't wear bangles like the bride. But there are some things they can do to spice up their look. 


Necklaces: Most Muslim grooms wear necklaces that match either their own colors or the accessories of the bride. That can be a pearl or gold finished necklace and it can be a short set or a long and short duo. 

Flowers: Nothing brings out the charm of a Muslim groom like a few flowers. You can add hanging jasmine flowers to the back of your turban, or wear a necklace of flowers. At the least, use your breast pocket to house a few. 

Ring: Muslim grooms don't always use wedding bands, but a groom should certainly use a ring with a nice stone that matches his clothing. This makes you look regal. 

Dupatta: A thin dupatta around the neck is nice, but a full woolen, embroidered shawl hung on your shoulder and arm is perfect for a Muslim groom outfit. 

Shoes: If you aren't into men's jutti, or you don't have the time to break them in, wear new, polished dress shoes. Your dress socks, of course, should match your shoes.


So what does a Muslim groom wear?  Whether it’s a thobe with traditional eastern shoes, a shalwar kameez with a long sherwani, or an embroidered sherwani with matching pants, each option offers a unique and stylish look for the big day. By carefully selecting the right fabrics, colors, and accessories, you can create a memorable and regal appearance that reflects your values and personality -- the best wedding dress for a Muslim groom!
