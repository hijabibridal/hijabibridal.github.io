The outfit consists of two pieces: the Tahtiya, an inner dress made of fine, shiny fabric that is long-sleeved and modest, and the Dfina (or Fouqia), an outer, more elaborate over-dress that is sheer and richly decorated. Both pieces have a fancy collar and button up the front with traditional closures. This White Moroccan Wedding Kaftan is designed to accentuate the waist with a belt (mdamma) and is perfect for Muslim wedding dresses, special occasions, and formal events.\n<h2 class=\"text-[#db2777] text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4\">How to wear</h2>this Dress for White Muslim Wedding  \nThis Muslim wedding coordinates with styling for bridal looks that beautifully incorporate the hijab. Head coverings can be matched in color and decoration with the takchita, enhancing the outfit’s harmony. A popular way to wear a white hijab wedding dress is to tuck the hijab neatly into the neckline of the caftan, creating a seamless and modest look. Alternatively, brides can opt for a layered effect for volume or a turban style for a chic, contemporary edge. Adding a coordinating scarf or shawl (dupatta) over the hijab elevates the overall elegance, making it a distinctive and expressive choice for the celebration. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://hijabibridal.github.io/shop/category/white\" class=\"text-[#db2777] font-bold hover:underline\">Shop this color collection</a><br /><a href=\"https://hijabibridal.github.io/shop/category/muslim-wedding-dresses\" class=\"text-[#db2777] font-bold hover:underline\">View all Muslim Wedding Dresses</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://hijabibridal.github.io/shop/category/white\" class=\"text-[#db2777] font-bold hover:underline\">Shop this color collection</a><br /><a href=\"https://hijabibridal.github.io/shop/category/muslim-wedding-dresses\" class=\"text-[#db2777] font-bold hover:underline\">View all Muslim Wedding Dresses</a>",
