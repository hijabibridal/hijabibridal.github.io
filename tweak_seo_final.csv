The regal look and ease of movement of these Muslim&nbsp; wedding dresses makes them ideal for long celebrations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike other blue Islamic wedding dresses&nbsp;that have a skirt, this Aqua Muslim Wedding Sharara is a traditional three-piece ensemble consisting of a kurta or kameez (long or short top), a heavily flared pair of pants (sharara bottoms) and a dupatta.

A somewhat crisp fabric, net is used to add volume and structure, often with embroidery that enhances its defined shape. Embellishments in champagne color are balanced between the pants and kurta with simple work on the dupatta for a cohesive ensemble in this Aqua Muslim Wedding Sharara. The pants and top are heavily embroidered in floral patterns. So the embroidery on this set ranges from subtle to elaborate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sizes are measured at the bust in inches:(XXS-34),(XS-36),(S-38),(M-40),( L-42),( XL-44) and (XL-46).

Its voluminous, flared silhouette and ornate embellishments reflected the grandeur of Mughal court fashion. Bridal shararas have deep cultural roots tracing back to the Mughal era and are especially popular among Muslim brides in South Asia as a blue Muslim wedding dress.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sharara dresses are especially preferred for occasions that call for traditional elegance and comfort. Shararas are preferred over other dresses for weddings, festive events and formal gatherings due to their comfort, elegance and rich cultural heritage. The signature wide-legged, flared pants are the defining feature, creating a graceful and dramatic look that distinguishes the bridal sharara from other ethnic outfits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>View price and purchase on Amazon: <a href=""https://amzn.to/3GGRjsi"">https://amzn.to/3GGRjsi</a> in color Choice 1.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>How to Personalize your Aqua Muslim Wedding Sharara</strong></u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When you select a pastel color like aqua, you can mix it with luxurious fabrics like georgette, silk for your dupatta and hijab. What about your hair?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>	<p>This sharara begs for a braided crown, or just braids period for a regal, intricate look. Try braiding hair on both sides and pinning it across the crown, perfect for formal and traditional events, or wear a different braided updo.<br>	&nbsp;</p>	</li>	<li>	<p>To disguise your braided updo, you can <a href=""https://hijabibridal.wixsite.com/hijabi-bridal/bridal-hijab"">wrap the hijab</a> in a turban style for a chic, modern vibe! Or go for volume around the face. A graceful look, frame the hijab around your face with some volume on top by loosely wrapping or pleating the fabric, which pairs beautifully with the sharara’s flared silhouette and makes braids less noticeable under your hijab.<br>	&nbsp;</p>	</li>	<li>	<p>Because your main dupatta is understated, <a href=""https://hijabibridal.wixsite.com/hijabi-bridal/bridal-dupatta-collection"">wear a second dupatta</a> with detailed embroidery, sequins, or a rich border to serve as a focal point. Try our hijab looks to wear the second, embroidered dupatta to the back. So just cover your head (and hijab) with the dupatta and let the rest fall over your shoulders. This traditional style is popular for brides and formal occasions, exuding modesty and classic charm. Then neatly pleat the man, standard dupatta and place it over one shoulder. Pin it in place with a brooch or safety pin for a structured, formal appearance-perfect for weddings.<br>	&nbsp;</p>	</li></ul><p><strong>View price and purchase on Amazon: <a href=""https://amzn.to/3GGRjsi"">https://amzn.to/3GGRjsi</a> in color Choice 1.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>Best Accessories for the Aqua Muslim Wedding Sharara</strong></u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>View our <a href=""https://hijabibridal.wixsite.com/hijabi-bridal/blue-bridal-collection"" target=""_blank"">Blue Bridal Collection&nbsp;for all options</a> in this color.&nbsp; Thoughtful accessorizing with <a href=""https://hijabibridal.wixsite.com/hijabi-bridal/nikkah-jewelry"">jewelry</a>, belts, and stylish dupatta draping further elevates the look, allowing for personalization and statement-making style.

If you're looking for a Moroccan Wedding Kaftan to wear as a lavender Islamic wedding dress, it's easy to accommodate the difference.

Fabrics like chiffon, satin&nbsp;or silk are common for the <a href=""https://hijabibridal.wixsite.com/hijabi-bridal/bridal-hijab"">hijab to complement</a> the luxurious texture of the wedding caftan. The choice and style of head covering can also reflect regional traditions and personal taste, making the overall look more distinctive and expressive:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>	<li>A popular and elegant way to wear a wedding caftan with a hijab is to tuck the hijab neatly into the neckline of the caftan. This style creates a seamless, modest look that highlights the intricate details of the caftan’s neckline and embroidery while ensuring full coverage and comfort. The loose ends of the hijab are tucked inside the caftan’s neckline or collar, giving a polished and clean finish.<br>	&nbsp;</li>	<li>If you don't like it tucked in, try a layered effect for volume.<br>	&nbsp;</li>	<li>Or wrap your hijab in a turban style or a wrap-around headscarf for a chic, fashion-forward look. This style is especially popular for brides seeking a contemporary edge.<br>	&nbsp;</li>	<li>Many women drape a<a href=""https://hijabibridal.wixsite.com/hijabi-bridal/bridal-dupatta-collection""> coordinating scarf or shawl (dupatta)</a> over their hair or hijab for added elegance.

Unlike the gharara, which has a visible seam or joint at the knee where the fabric is gathered or pleated for extra volume, the sharara’s flare is continuous and seamless from the waist down. Shararas are known for their comfort and ease of movement due to the loose, flowing cut, making them ideal for weddings, and this one ideal as a peach Muslim bridal dress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>View price and purchase on Amazon: <a href=""https://amzn.to/4ipCrwE"">https://amzn.to/4ipCrwE</a>.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u><strong>How to Personalize your Peach Wedding Sharara for Muslim Brides</strong></u></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This bridal sharara already blends heritage craftsmanship with modern aesthetics - combining classic embroidery with a contemporary peach color.

A: A Muslim wedding typically emphasizes modesty in attire, which includes formal wear that covers the legs, arms and chest. Brides often wear modest formal gowns that feature luxurious fabrics and intricate embroidery.. Additionally, a hijab is commonly worn, but is not required by the non-Muslim guests at an event all, although it's a courtesy to wear it to a mosque.

Q: What should guests wear to a Muslim wedding?
A: Guests attending a Muslim wedding should also prioritize modesty in their clothing choices, opting for formal wear or dressy clothing that covers the arms, legs and chest. It is common for women to wear fancy dresses, while men typically wear traditional attire or formal suits. A hijab may be worn by female guests, especially if the wedding takes place in mosques, but one is not required in event halls.

Q: Can I wear a hijab to a Muslim wedding?
A: Yes, wearing a hijab to a Muslim wedding is not only acceptable but is a sign of good will. The hijab can beautifully complement dressy clothing, enhancing the overall elegance of the outfit. Whether the wedding is held in mosques, event halls or outdoor locations, a hijab adds a refined touch to the ensemble. If the bride and guests are wearing hijab, you won't be out of place.
